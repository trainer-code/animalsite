        <p>Traditionally, out of season gundogs are swapped onto a maintenance ration, (for example Skinner’s Maintenance or Maintenance Plus), which is typically lower in nutrients, (especially protein and fat), than provided in season.</p>
        <p>Indeed, if the activity level of a dog is dramatically reduced, this is a sensible move to avoid the perils of weight gain and obesity in extreme cases. In the run up to the start of the new season it’s useful to start making nutritional changes onto a higher nutritional profile, (for example, Skinner’s Working 23 or Muesli Mix), in advance of the first day – ideally gradually introducing a more nutrient dense/rich food about a month before.</p>
        <p>When introducing the new food, do so gradually, ideally over 5-7 days to allow the digestive system (and all the microbes that live in it) to adapt and hopefully avoid any digestive upset. </p>  
        <p>As your dog’s energy requirements increase in the run up to the start of the season, gradually increase the amount fed, ideally in at least two meals a day to ensure maximal digestion.</p>  
        <p>For some dogs however, especially those who have continued with different activities out of season, there might have been very little dietary alteration. Indeed, science is increasingly suggesting that keeping your dog on the same nutrient profile (especially fat levels in their diet) out of season, can help maintain their metabolism to deal with those nutrients in season.</p>
